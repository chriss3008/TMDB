##  🕵About

This project copies a few functionalities of [**The Movie Database**](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using its own [**API**](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/). Users can see the most popular movies and tv shows on that day and can also see more details about titles and the cast by clicking on them. The site is responsive and was tested on both mobile and desktop.
