##  🕵About

This project copies a few functionalities of [**The Movie Database**](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using its own [**API**](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/). Users can see the most popular movies and tv shows on that day and can also see more details about titles and the cast by clicking on them. The site is responsive and was tested on both mobile and desktop.

This is a responsive Front-end project used as a study case to show my abilities in working with the technologies described in [Technologies](#Technologies).

##  🔨Functionalities
 
   * On the homepage, the top 20 most popular movies/tv shows are rendered;
   * All the movies/tv shows genres are also rendered, and they can be clicked on to filter the rendered movies/tv shows by genre (more than one genre can be chosen);
   * There is pagination. Both the Filters and the Pagination are saved so that the user can refresh the page and their choices will still be there;
   * You can click on any movie to load more details about it;
   * On the Movie Details page, there is more info, like cast, crew, trailer, other recommended movies, user score, etc.;
   * The user can click on the cast members to load more information about that person, including other movies they were featured in;
   * The image on the banner can be clicked on to return to the home page.
